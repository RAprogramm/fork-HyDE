# The theme switch used to sanitize "hypr.theme" into "themes/theme.conf" and
# the colour pass used to write "themes/wallbash.conf". Both are generated for
# Hyprland alone, and Hyprland now reads the Lua state instead, so neither file
# is written any more. What is left behind is not inert: whatever sources them
# keeps applying the last theme that was ever generated, silently overriding
# the Lua state with stale borders, gaps and fonts.
#
# The colour include, "themes/colors.conf", is untouched. It is still generated
# on every colour pass because hyprlock sources it and has no Lua configuration.
#
# Nothing is deleted. The files are moved into a backup directory, and the lines
# that source them are commented out in the user's own hyprlang files rather
# than removed, so a user who wants them back has both the file and the include.
